# Jira deployment info action

Note: this repo is currently experimental and is used only for personal usage!
Unfortunately, Github doesn't have support for private actions yet. See https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74

## What it will do

- It will tag an commit (i.e. 'production-deployment'), indicating which commit has last been deployed to a certain environment
- It will extract Jira issue number from all commit messages between the latest tag and the latest commit on the specified branch
- It will upload this deployment info to Jira
- It will create a new tag on the latest commit
- this process will repeat itself on every run

## Usage

  - name: Deploy to Production

## Development

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- Edit the code inside `index.ts`
- Unfortunately it's pretty hard to write tests for this action
- Upon committing a husky hook gets triggered, which will result in transpiling and bundling the action right-away (gh-actions requires that your action-repo is a standalone runnable, so a `npm install` shouldn't be needed when running the action)
